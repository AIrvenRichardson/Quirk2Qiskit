HI!

You might be wondering what all this junk is. First of all it's probably not helped by the fact that I'm not super comfortable with web developlment, so I'm reusing an old practice project as a base to work off of!
The goal here is to make the readcircuit.py code into javascript so it can be run on my github pages. Because I highly doublt a python script that can only be run locally is actually efficent for anyone with its current capabilities!
So bear with my awful javascript, if you have any suggestions or improvements, please contact me or make an issue or something (idk if my settings allow for that atm). Email airvenrichardson@gmail.com if I have yet to set up forks!

Thank you for your interest in my project!!!
